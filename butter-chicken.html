                <h3>Step 5 Tips for making restaurant-style Butter Chicken</h3>
                <p>1. The size of the chicken matters. If you are using a small and young chicken, 4 hours of marination works. If the chicken you are using is larger sized or older chicken, marinate it for at least 12 to 16 hours to get tender butter chicken. 2. If you don't have hung curd, you can use thick curd too, but the cooking time might increase. 3. Turn the stove off while adding chilled cream to the gravy otherwise the gravy may curdle. This, or you can take a small amount of gravy in a separate bowl and add the cream. Mix well and then add it to the butter chicken. This way the cream will not curdle.</p>
