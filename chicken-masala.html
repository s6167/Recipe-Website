        Chilli chicken is a popular Indo-Chinese dish of chicken of Hakka

          <!-- step 1 -->
          <h3>Step 1 Wash the chicken and prepare the marinade</h3>
          <p>
            To make this delicious recipe, begin with washing the chicken in
            some lukewarm water and rinse it again in cold water. Then take a
            large bowl and combine chicken, eggs, ginger-garlic paste and
            cornflour in it. Mix all the ingredients properly. You can also
            drizzle a little water to the batter to coat the chicken pieces
            evenly. Once done, refrigerate the chicken for 1-2 hours.

          <h3>Step 2 Prepare the chilli chicken masala</h3>
          <p>
            After 1-2 hours, take out the marinade. Next, heat oil in a deep pan
            over a high flame. Carefully place the chicken pieces in the oil
            until cooked through. Remove and drain excess oil on absorbent
            paper. Meanwhile, heat 1 or 2 tbsps of oil in a separate pan over
            medium flame. Once the oil is sufficiently hot, add the onions and
            fry for 2-3 minutes till they turn translucent. Then add the
            capsicum and green chillies and mix well again. You can also add
            some dry roasted green chillies to accentuate the taste. Moreover,
            If you prefer the dish extra spicy, you can also add some
            vinegar-soaked green chillies to this recipe, as it adds to the
            taste and flavour. (optional)

          <h3>Step 3 Cook chicken in soy sauce & vinegar</h3>
          <p>
            When the veggies are partially cooked, add soy sauce, vinegar,
            chicken and salt. Mix all the ingredients well and make sure that
            the chicken is well coated in the sauces. Keep stirring so that the
            chicken does not stick to the pan.
